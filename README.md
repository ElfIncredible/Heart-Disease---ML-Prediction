## Project Overview

## Dataset

## Machine Learning Prediction
### Install dependencies
Set up the necessary imports for preprocessing data, splitting it into training and testing sets, creating a logistic regression model, and evaluating its accuracy.

### Data collection and processing
- Load the dataset from a CSV file into a DataFrame
- Inspect it by displaying the first few rows, checking its dimensions, summarizing statistics, and listing column names. I
- Check for missing values and examine the distribution of the target variable, which indicates whether the heart is defective (1) or healthy (0).

### Splitting features and target
- Separate the dataset into features (X) and the target variable (Y),
- Display the first few rows of each.
- Print the names of the feature columns for future use, such as in a web app interface.
